=======

The files in this repo are a brief display of the code I like to write i.e.,
code I'm proud of.  For ease of reviewing some additional comments have been
made to these files, for this reason I also link to the original files here.

Additionally, here is some context of _why_ I am proud of these snippets.  Apart
for the fact that they its just nice clean code.

## Hangman

File: `hangman.py`
Original: https://github.com/tcharding/hangman/blob/master/hangman.py

### Reason for inclusion

I hacked this up one Sunday afternoon with my kids sitting around the table, the
aim was to spark some interest in programming in them while they were doing
their various other craft activities.

Its included because it is so simple, I feel that code written quickly, simply,
and just for fun is a good representation of ones coding style.
